Based on the video **"Ex-Google Recruiter Explains Why 'Lying' Gets You Hired"** by Farah Sharghi, here are the nine key lessons for navigating job interviews strategically, formatted without links:

### 1. "How Are You?" – Small Talk is an Audition

* **The Lesson:** The interview starts the moment you walk in. Avoid being overly honest if you’re having a bad day.
* **Strategic Answer:** Always say you are "great." This demonstrates emotional regulation and professional resilience.
* **Why:** Hiring managers use this to gauge how you’ll show up on a difficult day at work.

### 2. "Why Do You Want to Work Here?" – Flip the Script

* **The Lesson:** Stop making it about what the company can do for you. Avoid generic answers about the company's "mission and values".
* **Strategic Answer:** Focus on what you can contribute to their goals and how you can solve their specific problems.
* **Why:** It shifts the dynamic from a "hopeful audition" to a meeting between two parties with something to offer.

### 3. "Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?" – Alignment is Key

* **The Lesson:** The interviewer isn't interested in your actual life plan (like grad school or starting a business).
* **Strategic Answer:** Affirm that you see yourself at the company, becoming an expert and a valuable team member.
* **Why:** They want to know if you will leave in six months or if your goals align with the role.

### 4. "Why are You Looking for a New Opportunity?" – Stay Positive

* **The Lesson:** Never "trash" a current employer, even if they are toxic or you are underpaid.
* **Strategic Answer:** Simply state that you’ve learned a lot and are ready for a "new challenge".
* **Why:** Negative comments make you appear as a high-risk candidate who might bad-mouth the new company later.

### 5. "How Do You Feel About Your Current Manager?" – Don't Hand Out Red Flags

* **The Lesson:** Be extremely careful, as you don't know the management style of your potential new boss.
* **Strategic Answer:** Focus on what you learned from their management style, even if it was difficult (e.g., learning "process" from a micromanager).
* **Why:** Complaining about a specific style (like micromanagement) might inadvertently insult your interviewer if that is how they lead.

### 6. Curate Your Hobbies to Be Memorable

* **The Lesson:** Don't list generic activities like "watching TV" or "hanging out with friends".
* **Strategic Answer:** Share a hobby that signals curiosity, patience, or skill-building (e.g., restoring a motorcycle or home baking).
* **Why:** It makes you memorable and paints a picture of a person people would want to work with.

### 7. Own Your Actual Work, Not Just Your Title

* **The Lesson:** If you performed duties above your official pay grade, you must claim them.
* **Strategic Answer:** Clearly articulate the value you created and the leadership you took, regardless of your official HR title.
* **Why:** Under-selling yourself allows less qualified but more confident candidates to take the role.

### 8. Handle Resume Gaps with Confidence

* **The Lesson:** A gap isn't a dealbreaker—the interviewer already saw it before calling you.
* **Strategic Answer:** Be matter-of-fact. If it was personal, say "I took time off for personal reasons/family commitments and now I'm ready to return".
* **Why:** Your energy matters more than the gap. Being defensive or apologetic signals that something is wrong.

### 9. Ask Strategic Questions at the End

* **The Lesson:** Never say "No, I think you covered everything".
* **Strategic Answer:** Ask questions like "What does success look like in the first 90 days?" or "What is the most immediate challenge I would need to tackle?".
* **Why:** The questions you ask demonstrate how you think and show that you are already picturing yourself in the role.
