# SXSW Sydney Day 2

## Featured | The Technology of Curiosity

Perplexity sets itself apart from a search engine because it does not return search results, instead, it returns answers to questions (with references). It aims to get the relevant facts and gives answers rather than just links. This is a new way of learning. 

Best questions makes better people. Learn by asking questions

Hallucination is still an issue even with answer-engine, and whichever LLM you use. It is not a feature, it is a bug.
It is a great learning experience when the answers shows transparency on the sources used to generate the answer.

New versions of foundation models seems to come out every 2 months, so at times, it is not a great idea to invest in creating a model. Or be heavily dependednt on a single model. And that is why not many people have model loyalty.

It is best to listen more than talking mores. 
A good practice to have retrospections to generate more questions like: what could we have done more / better.

There is a shift from SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) to GEO (Generative Engine optimisation). How can your sites appear in LLM results.

Try to create a better experience to people, and then get them to try it out. This is their goal with Perplexity, so it can be adopted by more users.

How do you get people to ask critical questions? In the age where answers are served in a silver platter, we try to get people to ask more details. They should also try to analyse the results.

What are the skills needed for the future? In a discussion, to not come in with a pre-determined result/answer. Continuously ask questions to understand what is on other peoples mind, and a follow up of "so what?" to get more details on how we came up with the answer, preferably collectively.

## Featured | Leading with Impact: Why Blindspotting is Your Secret Weapon

Blindspots are gaps with what you know versus what is reality.

What we learned from the start of our career is not always relevant to what we know now in our current career.

The most impactful leaders knows how to learn and unlearn what they used to know, and possibly when to relearn them again.

We are now the dinosaurs we referred to earlier in our careers.

We can either be the seekers or knowers. Neither is inherently bad or good, but it is best we know when to be either.

Seekers: They freely admit what they don't know. Asks questions to learn. Willing to rethink their ideas. And is comfortable with ambiguity.
Knowers: Believe they know and have the answers. Unaware of their biases. Uses questions to win. Uncomfortable with ambiguity.

An example of when it is best to be a knower: A doctor about to take out your apendix. You would want them to be sure of what they are doing and they are asking the right questions to achieve success in the operation they would be performing. 

"Adapt or die" - a takeaway line from the movie "Moneyball"

"Dunning Kreuger effect" - a cognitive bias where people with low ability in a specific area overestimate their competence, while high performers tend to underestimate theirs.
We are good at knowing where we are right but fail to show doubt when we maybe wrong.

To remedy blindspots, we must be honest, curiuous, and flexible.

"I do not know yet", is a great way to build trust.

Be Honest - Accept your intellectual limits; Disentangle your ego; Hunt for your biases
Be Curious - Search for the truth; Pursue different perspectives; Question for insight
Be Flexible - Read the room; Embrace ambiguity; Keep an open mind

Objective truths are based on facts that can be observed, measured, and tested. Facts that hold up under scruitiny regardless of our personal views or opinions.

Actively seek opinions that are not uour own. Actively seek people who thinks differently and opposed to your ideas. This will give you a different perspective, and a practice for critical thinking.

It is okay to have a solid view, it is also okay to have other people have different views from yourself.

"What if we were wrong? What if we were honest with admitting with what we do not know?"

It is good to confront our mistakes and ask for help.

## AI vs AI: The Cybercrime State of Origin

It is advisable to build some in-house threat detection systems.

You can now rent out AI to build bad actors for phising emails and other malicious digital attacks.
Both Defensive and Attacker AI can be sold and bought.

The new threat is that the attacks can be done en-mass with AI. Such as Mass phising campaigns, (Because malicious AI craft kits are available). Spear-phising is easier because we are able to scrape profiles in the web.

An advise is to understand the tools you use and how it can be used against you.

There is also a need to use the tools available to protect the broader economy.

Scams are now likely being built by AI.

Building target campaigns is easier with AI. Data scraping is now availoable with less skills. There is also a change in strategy where a focus from high value to high volume is obeserved in the atacks. To impersonate users, they scrape social media platforms to find things like writing tones, personal details, and possible connections.

Bad actors can easily scaffold website clones with the use of AI applications like lovable, bolt, etc.

How they are using it. Find a target website and copy their login flow and page. Create a phising emails, and do this in scale at pace.

Interesting thought. Find out how much AI knows about you online. try out things like perplexity, google gemini, and openai.

The aim is to take out the bad actors and vulnerabilities before it gets weaponised.

You have to understand the theat level, is it benign or malicious. Understand the fidelity

We can use AI to find the malicious actors

AI can do the repetetive tasks

Use AI to collaborate with humans. What do we need to prepare for, because AI keeps getting better every month. If we can, use AI to fight Bad Actors with AI. 

Companies should invest in AI protection.

Now is the best time to learn more about cyber security.

## Creating Climate Consultants: A Youth Pipeline for the Green Economy

Green skills jobs are abundant. We need people to fill those jobs.

Sustainability w/o sacrifice results in a hefty price tag or poor quality.

Small gaols: We should have a limit on paper usage.

Entrepreneurship for the youth: paper runs, fish and chips shops.

There is a need to develop the entrepreneurial skills for the youth. Need them to take rishs and see possible changes.

Being young in the new digital age asks the questions: What can you create? This might help with the development of entreprebeurial skills for the youth.

Social Enterprise in non-conventional roles.

How can you engage with the community?

There's always different ways to do businesses. Maybe you can use a string ethos to drive change.

How to engage w/ young people? How do you get them to think about the environment?

We should drive awareness.

We can use Community and a sense of fun to drive change. sillyness anda bit of delight | substance and silly.

The new climate target of Australia is not so bad. At 75%, is it better than previous targets, we have set.

## Featured | Beyond the Myths: Building Your AI-First Future

AI is not perfect and is really messy.

With AI, you (and companies) should start adopting and working with AI or get left behind.

Lead with Vision and not Hype. AI will transform every element of our lives.

Story: Jimmy the Sufter is a Pizza Agent which, post-pizza checks in on customers if they liked the pizza.

What works with AI: Data Reality Check, Focus on business outcomes, change readiness and talent.

We need to train more people with AI, and improve their AI literacy. 

We must build trust into the core AI strategy, because AI can be trusted if used responsibly.

Things to look out for and consider with AI: Transparency, Reliability, Security, Bias, Risks.

Biases in the training model affects the output.

Have an AI transparency dashboad in your company. Which you can rank the AI's version number with a trust metrics. Consider LLM evaluators.

Terminologies: A2A - Agent to Agent, B2A - Business to Agent, P2A - Person to Agent

How do you keep and break trust (in AI)? How to tell if it's true or not? To train AI, you must correctly label which is Real and Generated by AI.

60% of AI agent projects fail because of "Bad Processes". Also consider that no-process is a bad process.

Top 3 actions in organisations:
1. Fix broken stuff first. 
2. Make winners win bigger
3. If customers hate it, kill it.

Activate AI agents as strategic teammates, redesign their roles.

Some jobs will go away, byt most just will evolve/transform with AI>

Use AI to go faster. Tell your team how to evolve their roles with AI.

Be the change because AI technology moves fast; but you do not have to learn them all.

Search Engine Optimisation is moving to Generative Enginer Optimisation. Meaning, that sites should be parsable and understandable for AI.

Three wishes for an AI-proof worlds: Build shared AI literacy. Lead with trust and vision. Experiment bodly, measure what matters.

## AI in Australia: Fact or Fiction

This is the session that talks about how Australia is fairing in the AI world stage.

What does "AI winning" mean?

US and CHina has better compute resources which allows them to train LLMs

Apate AI tries to break the worldiwide scam rings. They do this by extracting all the details form scammers using trained AI. They disrupt the scames. They figure out the scam fingerprint and the metadata. Finally, they figure out where the scam networks exists.

Relevance AI is an agent based automation. Their aim is to be the home of the AI workforce. They try to solve the questions, "How can you create an agent and how can you collaborate with it?". THey treat an agent as a coworker. 

"Health LIteracy" is something that is being addressed with OvumAI. It tracks women's health with devices, it provides feedback to researchers. THey feed AI with unbiased data as the data is the person's own. They try to close the gender health gap. They do this as well by marketing the app like how they market fashion.

You  can use smaller modesl with specific functions. Think of core principles focused on core advantages.

If AI is added to the national agenda, we might be able to bring our AI specialists back to Australia.

The will to be leading in the AI world is here, however, we need infrasctfucture, like being able to run training of LLMs in datacenters based in Australia. Our strength is that we nurture AU companies.

Australia is a bit frugal - one of the problems when it comes to the AI advancement in Australia.

With Venture captialism, the process seems to be tragetted more on the seasoned entrepreneurs.

However, we can use constraint as a competetive advantage. With our contsratints, AI companies from Australia seems to have very good quality of output.

Customer Due diligence is paramount for US based Venture Capitalists.

Tiktok algorithm is dangerous for young girls.

Being waway from the bubble can be beneficial to critical thinking.
