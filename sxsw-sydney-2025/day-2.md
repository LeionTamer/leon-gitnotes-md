## Featured | The Technology of Curiosity

Perplexity sets itself apart from a search engine because it does not return search results, instead, it returns answers to questions (with references). It aims to get the relevant facts and gives answers rather than just links. This is a new way of learning. 

Best questions makes better people. Learn by asking questions

Hallucination is still an issue even with answer-engine, and whichever LLM you use. It is not a feature, it is a bug.
It is a great learning experience when the answers shows transparency on the sources used to generate the answer.

New versions of foundation models seems to come out every 2 months, so at times, it is not a great idea to invest in creating a model. Or be heavily dependednt on a single model. And that is why not many people have model loyalty.

It is best to listen more than talking mores. 
A good practice to have retrospections to generate more questions like: what could we have done more / better.

There is a shift from SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) to GEO (Generative Engine optimisation). How can your sites appear in LLM results.

Try to create a better experience to people, and then get them to try it out. This is their goal with Perplexity, so it can be adopted by more users.

How do you get people to ask critical questions? In the age where answers are served in a silver platter, we try to get people to ask more details. They should also try to analyse the results.

What are the skills needed for the future? In a discussion, to not come in with a pre-determined result/answer. Continuously ask questions to understand what is on other peoples mind, and a follow up of "so what?" to get more details on how we came up with the answer, preferably collectively.

## Featured | Leading with Impact: Why Blindspotting is Your Secret Weapon

Blindspots are gaps with what you know versus what is reality.

What we learned from the start of our career is not always relevant to what we know now in our current career.

The most impactful leaders knows how to learn and unlearn what they used to know, and possibly when to relearn them again.

We are now the dinosaurs we referred to earlier in our careers.

We can either be the seekers or knowers. Neither is inherently bad or good, but it is best we know when to be either.

Seekers: They freely admit what they don't know. Asks questions to learn. Willing to rethink their ideas. And is comfortable with ambiguity.
Knowers: Believe they know and have the answers. Unaware of their biases. Uses questions to win. Uncomfortable with ambiguity.

An example of when it is best to be a knower: A doctor about to take out your apendix. You would want them to be sure of what they are doing and they are asking the right questions to achieve success in the operation they would be performing. 

"Adapt or die" - a takeaway line from the movie "Moneyball"

"Dunning Kreuger effect" - a cognitive bias where people with low ability in a specific area overestimate their competence, while high performers tend to underestimate theirs.
We are good at knowing where we are right but fail to show doubt when we maybe wrong.

To remedy blindspots, we must be honest, curiuous, and flexible.

"I do not know yet", is a great way to build trust.

Be Honest - Accept your intellectual limits; Disentangle your ego; Hunt for your biases
Be Curious - Search for the truth; Pursue different perspectives; Question for insight
Be Flexible - Read the room; Embrace ambiguity; Keep an open mind

Objective truths are based on facts that can be observed, measured, and tested. Facts that hold up under scruitiny regardless of our personal views or opinions.

Actively seek opinions that are not uour own. Actively seek people who thinks differently and opposed to your ideas. This will give you a different perspective, and a practice for critical thinking.

It is okay to have a solid view, it is also okay to have other people have different views from yourself.

"What if we were wrong? What if we were honest with admitting with what we do not know?"

It is good to confront our mistakes and ask for help.
