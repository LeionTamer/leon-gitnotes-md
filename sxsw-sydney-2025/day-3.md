# SXSW Sydney Day 3

## Owning the Audience: A Founder’s Journey to Global Scale and AI Innovation

The work culture in Australia and the US are different. You can even hear it from the accent where the Aussies end their statements with a question like tone, while the Americans have a more commanding tone. Americans can eat us Aussies when it comes to debates just by the tones.

LinkTree (a company) has a creator-first ethos where they ask themselves the question. "How are we actually helping the creators?".

Have a mindset to "Create Fast, learn more". Which make include scenarios where you can fail. And that is alright, as failure also has lessons to be learned.

There is a need to educate users on what AI can do for them, such as how AI agents can assist them with their tasks.

Ship quick, see what fails, ask/check what customer wants. Early and constant feedback is a great way to build trust in your product.

## SXSW Sydney Hackathon Brainstorm: Supercharge your work

In the age of AI, we should have an "Adopt or Die" mindset. This means you need to prepare your team on how to skill them up with AI.

Problem Situation: How can we get read of silos. People and teams are a in silos, and we need to either break them or create ways for the individuals and teams to collaborate. Sometimes teams and individuals do not talk with each other and that is the problem we want to solve.

Problem Situation: Shifting the cognitive load. How can we make our work smarter / more sustainable. How can we make our data/work more collaborate. Maybe we need to index our work?

Problem Situation: There is a Marketing Stigma against AU. How can you get the team to use AI? Company thinks that they are not considered "legacy" but without adopting AI, they can easily turn into legacy in a matter of months. How can we use AI to help manage our IP and creative assets. How can we use AU safely and legally?

Problem Situation: How can we homogenize and retail the uniqueness in creativity and of culture in the world of AI? Can we leverage AI for copywriting?

Safe AI Model (SAM) - We should have AI be used safely and responsibily. 

Problem Situation: We also have "Organisation Amnesia" where the employees get lost on where to start looking for documents within the organisation. We must also have a way to prevent redundancy.

Problem Situation: We wantNeo-Intelligence in the Construction Space. How do we connect with the comminity of AI Labs? We need to set priortity for the team; what is more helpful; what is more important?

Problem Situation: Multiple platforms as Silos. How can we develop our digital twins? Jow can we leverage AI for personal use?

Problem Situation: How can we have Digital Team members? a member that can be part of the product team, go-to-market team, and something like a business member.

Problem Situation: How can we Culture Fit AI? How can you have your personality with AI? How can we use AI to integrate personal skills? 

## Featured | Skynet in the Boardroom: Is AI Hijacking Your Business Strategy?

How can we use AI to manage decision making in the boardroom>

Microdecisions are made by the developers and engineers, The big decisions are made my board members.

AI is the incremental truth teller and liar at the same time. 

We ask the question: Who owns the risk in a company/decision?

Automation is not the same as Automization

We should leverage AI to challenge the assumptions. You also need to think how to apply AI hollistically to the decision making.

What is the key challenge w/ boardroom decisions? It is the alignment of the members with the other members.

CEOs are time poor. They only hav 4% time for ideation. What could be the solution to generate time.

"Predictive analysis should use AI more. And AI does not always mean generative AI. Is there a tool for strategic thinking?

In strategic planning, hallucination is not always a bad thing. Sometimes, it can be useful.

Business models turn into business model patterns. and with AI it can further decompose it.

There is a trend in Social media called "AI Doom"

## Featured | Embrace the Chaos – The Unexpected Path to Breakthrough Ideas

Constraints are good. Canvases that are too empty might not resolve into ideas. 

We can look for creativity from chaos. Opposite from whay everyone else knows.

Story: Long Island Iced Tea came about during the prohibition era. Because the people were not allowed to go drinking, so they created a very potent drink that looks like Iced Tea.

Story: Capoeira also rooted from prohibition. They hid they contacts into dance.

What can drive inspirations? Unpredictability, constrationst, emotions, unlearning, and noise.

We are prediction making machines.

Story: Jaws machine became iconic because the shark machine broke down when submerged in salt water.

"Emergency evolves into energence"


Workplaces are trying tos tamp out chaos, which in trun, stamps out creativity.

"Revenue per employee" is the new metric.

3 ways to condition creativity: Time constration, collisions, and role play.

Predictability is safe until it's not.

Think like a drug smuiggler.

Common constraints: Label constrain, budget constraint, product road blocks.

Emotions are our iniyion advantage over technology.

AI cannot feel emotions, cannot touch it.

It is best to try to create something when you have hightened emotions (like angry and super happy).

Emotion is a catalyst of creativity,

Proactively unlearn things. Expeirence is always a godo thing,

Exercise: Think of a chair, you will think of the standard shapes of a chair, but you do not think like what a dentist chair looks like.

When the world gets louder, our apetite gets smaller. It makes you retreat or shut-people out.

Creativity is a function of the library inside your head.

How do you remain open? Steal ideas.
