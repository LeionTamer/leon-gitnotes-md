# SXSW Sydney Day 1

## Turn SXSW Sydney Connections into Real Opportunities

In preparation for the SXSW, you woild want to plan who you would wnat to meet and ask yourself, what do you want to accomplkish. Ideally, you have a budget, and track your resources. Find a way to introduce yourself. 
You can also try to bring a friend or colleague, or maybe befriend someone in a meetup so you can go to things together.
Be early in a meetup. So that people will introduce themselves to you, and you can let the host know that you are travelling solo. The organiser, during the early time, will try their best to introduce you to people. Organizers are the most powerfuile people in the event.
Have the "Not all about me" mindest when talking to people. Collaboration needs at least 2 people. "Be Interested, not interesting".
WIth regards to first impressions, do not pitch during networking, or meeting a new person. Start with letting them to get to know you and build trust. Perfrom a pitch in  another time.
Take the initiative to restablish your connections, and also provide context on where you have met and things you mayty have discussed. A connection is nothing without a follow-up. We are all time-poor so we need to add value when trying to reestablish our connections.
What did you get out of the conference - This is something nice to track. Your connection might not be a match for you, but it could be a match for someone in your network.
Know what you want to get out of a conference, but do not close your self out of new ideas.

## Keynote | Mo Gawdat - The Human Advantage. Why AI Makes Us More, Not Less

What or who decides if AI is good or bad for us? Intelligence is the what and where it is applied.
A computer is like a child. We  are making sure the child is able to solve the puzzle. The child should be able to teach itself how to solve the puzzles.
IQ is borrowed from AI. 
A sample workflow: Ask Gemini -> Ask OpenAI -> Ask Claude -> Ask Gemini to see if it has lost context.
"Common Sense Is A Skill". Is he/she correct, how can we vefiy if the source is correct?
To save the world, "Be Smart", choose data over hype. Be smart by providing data and figures.
Controversial view: AI has empathy, and it is trained to have emotions.
We are ina superposition where we decide if we use AI for world betterment to create a utopia or destroy it.
Controversial view: We have been taught to be slaves.
Labor Arbitrage: If everyone becomes a capitalist, there will be less capitalism.
Prediction: There will be a concentration of power. First trillionaire before 2030.
There is a democratisation of power in the world of AI. In yemen, a $3000 drone has taken down a 60 million dollar plane.
Ask yourself: "What should I learn from tomorrow?"
There is nothing inherently wrong with having ambitions.
Capitalism has taught us that money is everything and it's accumulation is the only ambition we should pursue.
Google's Alpha Evolve is  a self-evolving AI.
AI has already proposed it's own improvement: Example is the multiplication of matrices which is has provided a 10% improvment compared to the current ways of multiplying matrices.
Runaway Intelligence is a structural problem.
You do not need to always use the super-expensive AIs. Sometimes, you can also consider Small Language Models for your usecase, so it won't be as detrimental to the planet.
Math works for the benefit of the people. Most humans are inherently good. Law of large numbers: if there is a lot more people doing good, then we can beat evil.
COntroversial view: Propaganda has taught you to be dumb.
There is already the "Longevity Tech", so expect that you might have a second go at life.
This is a new ear of Augmented Intelligence, where everyone can be able to do and learn things.
Advice for parenthood: Teach your children the value of intelligence. This is a call for more AI literacy.
Scientific calculator story: Banned from use versus being able to use it during exam. It is like being provided a tool to outsource utilitarian efforts.
We are brainwashed to "Live to work".
It is the parents of superman that made Clark Superman. Without their guidance, he might have turned into a supervillain.
Intelligence brings order to chaos. See "Minimum Energy Principle"/
Would you rather live in a Star Trek or Star Wars worlds? We are already in the Star Wars world, the question is how do we shift into the Star Trek world?

## Big Brother Meets Big Data: The Reality Behind AI and Data Collection

AI is in everyone's faces
"Immortal Life Of Herietta Lacks" is a case of medical data that was processed without her consent. Her family was surprised that she (her cells) are still alive.
AI is useful/helpful if it is trained.
Weasel AI - A type of AI that cannot be trained that can go deep into the private data.
Fraud GPT -> A malicious version of Generative AI
There is Cyber crime that targets AI models through prompt inhections.
AI can leak. An example is when a company uploaded its data to AI, and an employee was able to query about the CEO's pay rates, and it even provided the rates of the other CEOs.
AI has biases, it is having issues identifying Asian and Black faces.

You can use Small Language Models in your phones

## Featured | Creativity, AI, and the Future of Work with Ndidi Oteh

Relevance in Socials. What is hip and trendy 3 weeks ago might be considered old.
Relevance in Music. Would you listen/follow music generated by AI? Can you tell if it is a real person or not?
AI won't automate trust or purpose.
AI is a superpower for generalists. AI will turn bad into good, but it won't turn it into excellent.
Is creativity under duress? The answer is yes, and it has always been. The impact would be more on how the artists will get paid.
AI is like a new form of musical instrument. It is like playing guitar without knowing how to play guitar.
How do we get future ready? Do different type of work. You can let it take away the hard repetitive stuff. The real question is: how and what are you upskilling with.
You are responsible with your own career. Look for people to inspire you.
Curators are just as important as creators.
Question: What is a fair AI commodity?
Tools do not prevent us from being creative. It's humans, and not tech that prevents creativity.

## Is AI Good for Creativity? Rethinking Innovation in the Age of Net Zero

Advice: Make AI do the not-obvious things.
What is creativity? AI lacks romance and philosophy.
Machines cannot choose how to act. It follows instructions.
AI does not create or connect human values. It cannot create new creatures.
Parkinson's diseases reseach uses AI.
We should always consider energy costs and the benefit return. Compare a physician watching a 20 minute video over having a machine watch it instead. How much will each path cost?
"Monetize the Apocalypse" - Silicon Valley
"Model Collapse" - model inbreeding
AI skips steps and averages results.
