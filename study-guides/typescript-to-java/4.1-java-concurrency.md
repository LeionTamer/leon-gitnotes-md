# 4.1 Java Concurrency

## Threads vs. Event Loop
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in a separate thread");
});
thread.start();
```

## CompletableFuture and ExecutorService
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Result");

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
