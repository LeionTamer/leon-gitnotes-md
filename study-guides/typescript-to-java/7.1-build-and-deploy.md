## Maven Build Lifecycle and Packaging
```bash
// Terminal commands
mvn clean install
```

## Docker Containerization and CI/CD
- Package your application as a JAR/WAR.
- Use Dockerfile to containerize the application.
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile snippet
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/my-project.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

## CI/CD Practices
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI tools can be used.
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet
