# Python Dunder Methods and `__init__.py`

This response draws upon the provided source material to explain Python's dunder methods and the purpose of the `__init__.py` file.

## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods, also known as special methods or sometimes "magic methods" (though "dunder method" is a common Python colloquialism), are methods with names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`). They allow developers to deeply customize how custom classes interact with Python's features. While the Python documentation refers to them as special methods, "dunder method" is a common term used in the community.

### Core Dunder Methods

There are three dunder methods considered essential for most classes: `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.

- `__init__`: This is the **initializer** for a class. It is called when an object is created (after `__new__`). It does not return a value (returns `None`).
- `__repr__`: Customizes an object's string representation. It should always return a string. This method is particularly useful at the Python REPL and during debugging.
- `__eq__`: Customizes what it means for objects to be equal to one another. It typically returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), or `NotImplemented` if objects cannot be compared. The default implementation relies on the `is` operator, which checks for identity.

### Equality and Hashability

In addition to `__eq__`, Python has other dunder methods for determining the "value" of an object in relation to others.

- `__ne__`: Customizes the `!=` operation. It typically returns a boolean value. The default implementation calls `__eq__` and negates the boolean result, so it's almost never explicitly implemented.
- `__hash__`: Customizes the `hash()` function. It returns an integer. Hashable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or values in sets. By default, all objects are hashable, but if you implement a custom `__eq__`, your objects won't be hashable without also implementing `__hash__`. The hash value of an object must never change, so typically only immutable objects implement `__hash__`.

### Orderability

Python's comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) can be overloaded using dunder methods. These operators also power functions like `sorted`, `min`, and `max`.

- `__lt__`: For the `<` operator. Typically returns a boolean.
- `__gt__`: For the `>` operator. Typically returns a boolean.
- `__le__`: For the `<=` operator. Typically returns a boolean.
- `__ge__`: For the `>=` operator. Typically returns a boolean.

The `functools.total_ordering` decorator can be used if you implement all these operators in the typical way (e.g., `x < y` is the inverse of `y > x`).

### Type Conversions and String Formatting

Several dunder methods allow objects to be converted to different types.

- `__str__`: Customizes the `str()` conversion. It should always return a string. The default `__str__` implementation simply calls `__repr__`.
- `__bool__`: Customizes the `bool()` conversion and truthiness checks. It should always return a boolean. `__len__` is used as a fallback for truthiness if `__bool__` is not implemented.
- `__int__`: Customizes the `int()` conversion. It should always return an integer. Used for objects that should act like numbers.
- `__float__`: Customizes the `float()` conversion. It should always return a float. Used for objects that should act like numbers.
- `__complex__`: Customizes the `complex()` conversion. It should always return a complex number. Used for objects that should act like numbers.
- `__bytes__`: Customizes the `bytes()` conversion. It should always return bytes. Used for objects that can be converted to bytes, like for `memoryview`.
- `__format__`: Used by f-string conversions, `str.format()`, and the built-in `format()` function. It takes a format specifier string `s` and should always return a string.

### Context Managers

Objects used in a `with` block implement context manager dunder methods.

- `__enter__`: Called when entering a `with` block. Returns a value given to the `as` variable.
- `__exit__`: Called when exiting a `with` block. Takes exception type, exception instance, and traceback arguments. It can return a truthy/falsey value to indicate whether exceptions should be suppressed.

### Containers and Collections

Objects that act like data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) are collections.

- `__len__`: Customizes the `len()` function. Returns an integer. This is a very common dunder method.
- `__iter__`: Customizes the `iter()` function and is used for all forms of iteration (for loops, comprehensions, etc.). It must return an iterator. This is a very common dunder method.
- `__getitem__`: Customizes item access (e.g., `x[a]`). Returns any object. This is a common dunder method.
- `__setitem__`: Customizes item assignment (e.g., `x[a] = b`). Returns `None`. This is a common dunder method.
- `__delitem__`: Customizes item deletion (e.g., `del x[a]`). Returns `None`. This is a common dunder method.
- `__contains__`: Customizes the `in` operator (e.g., `a in x`). Returns a boolean. The `in` operator falls back to looping if `__contains__` is not implemented. This is a common dunder method.
- `__reversed__`: Customizes the `reversed()` function. Returns an iterator. This is a common dunder method.
- `__next__`: Necessary for creating a custom iterator. Customizes the `next()` function. Returns the next item. This is less common.
- `__missing__`: Only ever called by the `dict` class itself. Customizes `x[a]` for missing keys. Returns any object. This is uncommon.
- `__length_hint__`: Supplies a length guess for structures without `__len__`. Customizes `operator.length_hint(x)`. Returns an integer. This is uncommon.

### Callability

Objects that can be called like functions or classes rely on the `__call__` method.

- `__call__`: Customizes the call operation (e.g., `x(a, b=c)`). Returns any object. When a class _instance_ is called, its class's `__call__` method is used.

### Arithmetic Operators

Dunder methods are frequently used for "operator overloading," particularly for arithmetic operators. These can be mathematical (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`, `@`) or bitwise (`&`, `|`, `^`, `>>`, `<<`), and binary (between two values) or unary (before one value).

Binary operators often have both a left-hand method (e.g., `__add__`) and a right-hand method (e.g., `__radd__`). If the left-hand method on the first object returns `NotImplemented`, the right-hand method on the second object is attempted.

- **Binary Mathematical:** `__add__`, `__radd__` (`+`); `__sub__`, `__rsub__` (`-`); `__mul__`, `__rmul__` (`*`); `__truediv__`, `__rtruediv__` (`/`); `__mod__`, `__rmod__` (`%`); `__floordiv__`, `__rfloordiv__` (`//`); `__pow__`, `__rpow__` (`**`); `__matmul__`, `__rmatmul__` (`@`).
- **Binary Bitwise:** `__and__`, `__rand__` (`&`); `__or__`, `__ror__` (`|`); `__xor__`, `__rxor__` (`^`); `__rshift__`, `__rrshift__` (`>>`); `__lshift__`, `__rlshift__` (`<<`).
- **Unary:** `__neg__` (`-x`); `__pos__` (`+x`); `__invert__` (`~x`). The unary `+` typically has no effect, though some objects use it.

Arithmetic operators are sometimes used for non-arithmetic purposes, like string concatenation (`+`), sequence repetition (`*`), or set operations (`&`, `|`, `-`, `^`).

### In-place Arithmetic Operations (Augmented Assignment)

Python supports in-place operations (e.g., `x += y`) via augmented assignment statements. If a mutable object supports an arithmetic operation, it should implement the corresponding in-place dunder method.

- **In-place Methods:** `__iadd__` (`+=`); `__isub__` (`-=`); `__imul__` (`*=`); `__itruediv__` (`/=`); `__imod__` (`%=`); `__ifloordiv__` (`//=`); `__ipow__` (`**=`); `__imatmul__` (`@=`); `__iand__` (`&=`); `__ior__` (`|=`); `__ixor__` (`^=`); `__irshift__` (`>>=`); `__ilshift__` (`<<=`).

These methods typically return `self`. If an in-place method is not found, Python performs the operation followed by an assignment (e.g., `x = x + y`). Immutable objects typically do not implement these.

### Built-in Math Functions

Dunder methods exist for several math-related functions.

- `__divmod__`, `__rdivmod__`: Customizes `divmod(x, y)`, returning a 2-item tuple. `__rdivmod__` is checked if `__divmod__` returns `NotImplemented`.
- `__abs__`: Customizes `abs(x)`. Returns a float.
- `__index__`: For making integer-like objects. Returns an integer. Used by operations requiring true integers, like slicing, indexing, `bin()`, `hex()`, and `oct()`. Unlike `__int__`, it performs a lossless conversion.
- `__round__`: Customizes `round(x)`. Returns a Number.
- `__trunc__`: Customizes `math.trunc(x)`. Returns a Number.
- `__floor__`: Customizes `math.floor(x)`. Returns a Number.
- `__ceil__`: Customizes `math.ceil(x)`. Returns a Number.

### Attribute Access

These methods control what happens when accessing, deleting, or assigning attributes.

- `__getattribute__`: Called for _every_ attribute access (e.g., `x.anything`). Returns the attribute value. Implementing this is challenging due to potential recursion.
- `__getattr__`: Only called after Python _fails_ to find a given attribute (e.g., `x.missing`). Returns the attribute value.
- `__setattr__`: Customizes attribute assignment (e.g., `x.thing = value`). Returns `None`.
- `__delattr__`: Customizes attribute deletion (e.g., `del x.thing`). Returns `None`.
- `__dir__`: Customizes `dir(x)`. It should return an iterable of attribute names (as strings). The `dir` function converts the iterable to a sorted list.

The built-in `getattr`, `setattr`, and `delattr` functions correspond to these methods but are intended for dynamic attribute access.

### Other Categories

The source also briefly mentions dunder methods for:

- **Metaprogramming:** Customizing class creation and checks (`__prepare__`, `__instancecheck__`, `__subclasscheck__`, `__init_subclass__`, `__mro_entries__`, `__class_getitem__`).
- **Descriptors:** Objects that hook into attribute access on a class (`__set_name__`, `__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__`).
- **Buffers:** For low-level memory access (`__buffer__`, `__release_buffer__`).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** For async context managers and iterators (`__aenter__`, `__aexit__`, `__aiter__`, `__anext__`), and awaitable objects (`__await__`).
- **Construction and Finalizing:** `__new__` (constructor - creates the instance) and `__del__` (finalizer - called before deletion). Note that `__new__` is the constructor, not `__init__`, and you should rarely define `__new__`. `__del__` is the finalizer.

### Library-Specific Dunder Methods

Some standard library modules define dunder methods used only within that library, such as `__post_init__` (dataclasses), `__copy__`, `__deepcopy__`, `__replace__` (copy module), pickling methods, and `__fspath__` (path-like objects).

### Dunder Attributes

In addition to methods, Python has many non-method dunder attributes. Some common ones include:

- `__name__`: Name of a function, class, or module.
- `__module__`: Module name for a function or class.
- `__doc__`: Docstring for a function, class, or module.
- `__class__`: An object's class (use `type()` instead).
- `__dict__`: Where most objects store their attributes.
- `__slots__`: Used by classes for memory efficiency instead of `__dict__`.
- `__mro__`: A class's Method Resolution Order.
- `__bases__`: Direct parent classes of a class.
- `__file__`: File defining a module object.
- `__version__`: Commonly used for package versions.
- `__all__`: Customizes `from module import *` behavior.
- `__debug__`: `False` when Python is run with `-O`.

There are many more dunder attributes found on specific object types like functions, classes, instances, modules, exceptions, descriptors, etc..

The sources note that Python includes over 150 unique dunder names (methods and attributes) and recommend looking them up as needed rather than memorizing them. **It is not recommended to invent your own dunder methods**.

## The `__init__.py` File

The `__init__.py` file is an important part of Python packages. Its primary purpose is to **let Python know that a folder is a package**. Any folder containing an `__init__.py` file is recognized as a package, even if it contains no other modules.

- **Execution on Import:** The `__init__.py` file is automatically executed every time you import your package or access a module from the package. This makes it a suitable place for setup code for the package. For example, adding a `print` statement inside `__init__.py` will cause that message to be printed whenever the package is imported or accessed.

- **Controlling Imports:** `__init__.py` helps control what gets imported from a package. When you import a module from a package (e.g., `from notifications import email`), Python executes the `__init__.py` file in the `notifications` folder before importing the `email` module. Other import methods like `import notifications.email as mail` and `from notifications.email import send_email_notification` also work.

- **The `__all__` Variable and Star Imports:** By default, if you use a "star import" (`from package import *`), nothing will be imported from the package unless explicitly defined. You can control what gets imported with `from package import *` by adding an `__all__` variable (a list or tuple of strings) to the `__init__.py` file. Only the names (module names, function names, etc.) listed in `__all__` will be imported when using the star import. You can list module names or names imported into the `__init__.py` itself.

In summary, `__init__.py` serves to define a folder as a package, execute setup code on package import, and control the behavior of star imports via the `__all__` variable.
